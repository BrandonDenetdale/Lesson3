<h2>Brandon Denetdale</h2>

<p>My name is Brandon Denetdale and my educational goal is to learn as much as possible about cybersecurity and computer hardware to prepare myself for working in the field I intend to enter, which is cybersecurity as my dream career. 
In this course, I hope to gain an understanding of how code functions in multiple ways on the internet. 
In the future, I would also like to create a website for my father. 
I enjoy going for walks, spending time with my family, playing video games, and spending time with friends as some of my favorite hobbies. 
I'm so excited about learning to code and make websites in this class.</p>
